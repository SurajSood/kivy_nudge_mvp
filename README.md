# Method

## Nudges

[Nudge Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory) states that behavior and decisions can be significantly influenced by well-placed and well-timed reminders. Nudges have been demonstrated to have significant positive outcomes. 

## Machine Learning

Data will be passively collected locally on the Android or Apple device. This data will include sensor data as well as reactions to nudges. This data will be used to train models customized to each user. These models will ultimately maximize the effectiveness of the nudges provided to the user.
